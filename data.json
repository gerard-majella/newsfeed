These networks were designed to guarantee privacy through end-to-end encryption and were allegedly used by criminals for secure communication, but they quickly attracted the attention of law enforcement. What initially appeared to be an airtight weapon for prosecutors—massive hacks of encrypted messages that seemed to dismantle entire criminal networks— is becoming a legal minefield. To understand why, we first need a brief explanation of the technology. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and crypto-phones like EncroChat and SkyECC rely on asymmetric cryptography: messages are encrypted with public keys and can only be decrypted with private keys on the recipient’s device. This makes remote interception or cracking virtually impossible—unless the keys are intercepted or the network itself is hacked.","tags":["LAW"]},{"title":"Microsoft is Giving the FBI BitLocker Keys","source":"Schneier on Security","date":"2026-02-03T12:05:25.000Z","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/microsoft-is-giving-the-fbi-bitlocker-keys.html","summary":"Microsoft gives the FBI the ability to decrypt BitLocker in response to court orders: about twenty times per year.

These networks were designed to guarantee privacy through end-to-end encryption and were allegedly used by criminals for secure communication, but they quickly attracted the attention of law enforcement. What initially appeared to be an airtight weapon for prosecutors—massive hacks of encrypted messages that seemed to dismantle entire criminal networks— is becoming a legal minefield. To understand why, we first need a brief explanation of the technology. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and crypto-phones like EncroChat and SkyECC rely on asymmetric cryptography: messages are encrypted with public keys and can only be decrypted with private keys on the recipient’s device. This makes remote interception or cracking virtually impossible—unless the keys are intercepted or the network itself is hacked.","tags":["OT"]},{"title":"Drone sightings have doubled near UK military bases, warns British government","source":"The Record","date":"2026-02-02T13:12:40.000Z","url":"https://therecord.media/military-drone-sightings-double-uk-government","summary":"The surge in sightings has prompted the government to expand the powers available to service personnel to deal with the threat from uncrewed aerial vehicles without having to first involve law enforcement.","tags":["POWER"]},{"title":"Microsoft may give your encryption key to law enforcement upon valid request - here's how to keep it safe","source":"ZDNet","date":"2026-01-30T02:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-keep-pc-bitlocker-encryption-key-safe-from-fbi-microsoft/","summary":"Concerned about encryption and privacy?
