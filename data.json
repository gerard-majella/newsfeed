The provincial court in València found that prosecutors could not rely on digital evidence to prove their case when defendants had been refused access to the raw data harvested from Sky ECC -  denying experts the ability to test the reliability and authenticity of the data. The decision, released on 23 January, will have implications for future prosecutions that rely on intercept from police hacking operations into the Sky ECC and EncroChat encrypted phone networks, where there is no other evidence to prove criminal behavior.","tags":["OT"]}]},{"id":"finance","label":"Banking & Finance","description":"Keywords: finance, banking, fintech, investment, cryptocurrency, SEC, wire fraud","articles":[{"title":"Romanian Hacker Pleads Guilty to Selling Access to US State Network","source":"Security Week","date":"2026-02-23T11:53:35.000Z","url":"https://www.securityweek.com/romanian-hacker-pleads-guilty-to-selling-access-to-us-state-network/","summary":"Catalin Dragomir admitted in a US court to selling access to an Oregon state government office’s network.\nThe post Romanian Hacker Pleads Guilty to Selling Access to US State Network appeared first on SecurityWeek.","tags":["SEC"]},{"title":"FIIG Securities Fined AU$2.5 Million Following Prolonged Cybersecurity Failures","source":"The Cyber Express","date":"2026-02-10T09:28:08.000Z","url":"https://thecyberexpress.com/fiig-cyberattack-au2-5m-fine-fiig-securities/","summary":"The FIIG cyberattack exposed sensitive client data and led to a AU$2.5m Federal Court fine against FIIG Securities for cybersecurity failures.","tags":["SEC"]},{"title":"Why the UK needs to rethink the Investigatory Powers Act and allow intercept evidence in court","source":"Computer Weekly","date":"2026-02-03T05:52:00.000Z","url":"https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Why-the-UK-needs-to-rethink-the-Investigatory-Powers-Act","summary":"The Investigatory Powers Act (IPA 2016), at 10 years old, is now becoming seriously out of date.
